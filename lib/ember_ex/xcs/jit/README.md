# EmberEx JIT Optimization System

## Overview

The Just-In-Time (JIT) optimization system improves the performance of EmberEx operators by analyzing and optimizing their execution at runtime. It provides several optimization strategies that can be selected automatically or explicitly by the user.

## Features

- **Automatic Optimization**: Automatically selects the best optimization strategy for each operator
- **Multiple Strategies**: Supports trace-based, structural, and enhanced optimization strategies
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks compilation and execution metrics for analysis
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Adapts to changing execution patterns
- **Compatibility**: Works with all EmberEx operators and custom functions

## Optimization Strategies

The JIT system includes three main optimization strategies:

1. **Trace-based (`:trace`)**: Analyzes the execution path of operators with specific inputs to optimize for similar future inputs.
2. **Structural (`:structural`)**: Analyzes the structure of operators without execution to identify optimization opportunities.
3. **Enhanced (`:enhanced`)**: Combines both trace-based and structural analysis for maximum optimization.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```elixir
alias EmberEx.XCS.JIT.Core, as: JIT

# Create an operator
operator = EmberEx.Operators.SequenceOperator.new(
  operators: [
    EmberEx.Operators.MapOperator.new(fn: fn inputs -> %{value: inputs.value * 2} end),
    EmberEx.Operators.MapOperator.new(fn: fn inputs -> %{value: inputs.value + 1} end)
  ]
)

# Apply JIT optimization
optimized_operator = JIT.jit(operator)

# Use the optimized operator
result = optimized_operator.(%{value: 5})
```

### Advanced Usage

```elixir
# Select a specific optimization strategy
optimized_operator = JIT.jit(operator, mode: :enhanced)

# Configure optimization options
optimized_operator = JIT.jit(
  operator,
  mode: :trace,
  force_trace: false,
  recursive: true,
  preserve_stochasticity: false
)

# Get JIT performance statistics
stats = JIT.get_jit_stats()

# Analyze strategy selection
analysis = JIT.explain_jit_selection(operator)
```

## Configuration Options

- **`mode`**: Strategy to use (`:auto`, `:trace`, `:structural`, `:enhanced`)
- **`force_trace`**: Whether to force retracing on each call
- **`recursive`**: Whether to optimize nested operators
- **`preserve_stochasticity`**: Ensures stochastic operations like LLMs produce different outputs even with identical inputs
- **`sample_input`**: Example input for eager compilation

## Performance Considerations

- The JIT system adds a small overhead on first execution but improves subsequent executions
- For very simple operators, the overhead might outweigh the benefits
- For complex operator chains, especially with nested structures, performance improvements can be significant
- Memory usage increases with the number of compiled graphs in the cache

## Implementation Details

The JIT system consists of several components:

- **Core**: The main API and strategy selector
- **Cache**: Stores compiled graphs and performance metrics
- **Strategies**: Different optimization approaches
- **Graph Builders**: Construct optimized execution graphs
- **Execution Engine**: Executes the optimized graphs

Each component is designed to be modular and extensible for future enhancements.
